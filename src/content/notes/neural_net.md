Quick reference for common git workflows:

## Feature Branch Workflow

1. Create feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

2. Regular commits with conventional commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
```

3. Rebase before merging:
```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```
